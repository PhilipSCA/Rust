# Getting started
1. Download rustup from the [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Run the exe. Follow the simple on-screen instructions for a quick install.
3. Rust is installed! Open a new visual studio code project.
4. Type `cargo new [project name]`, rust will automatically **create** a project folder and the needed files to run a rust project. *(You won't need to create the folder yourself.*
5. It will provide you by default, with a hello world program. cd into the new directory and type cargo run to build and test the new project.


# Variables
#### Assigning a variable
To initialise a variable, use the `let` keyword.
```rust
let x = 45
```
#### Assigning multiple variables
```rust
let (x,y) = (23,34)
```
#### Mutability
By default, this variable is also known as **immutable** *(it can't be changed)*. If you were to run `x = 20`, you would get an error.
To change this, we use the `mut` keyword.
```rust
let mut x = 45
```
This makes the variable **mutable**, so is able to be changed.
#### Constants
To make a variable constant, use the `const` keyword.
```rust
const MAX_INT = 200;
```
#### Integer Types
```rust 
let x = 2
```
As the default in Rust, this code will create a **signed 32-bit integer**.
In order to change the integer type, use a colon `(:)` after the variable name.
For example:
```rust
let x:u64 = 123
```
This code will create an **unsigned 64-bit integer**.
|Length|Signed|Unsigned|
|------|------|--------|
|8-bit|`i8`|`u8`|
|16-bit|`i16`|`u16`|
|32-bit|`i32`|`u32`|
|64-bit|`i64`|`u64`|
|128-bit|`i128`|`u128`|

***Note, for floats it is the same syntax, replace `i`/`u` with `f`***
#### More on Initialising Varaibles
It is always good practice in Rust to show the data type for each variable. Although it is not always necessary. For example:
```rust
let IsOpen = true
```
Will work fine, however it is always good practice to define it like this instead:
```rust
let ISOpen:bool = true
```

# Strings
There are two types of strings
1. Primitive string -> Immutable, fixed-length string in memory.
2. String -> Growable, heap-allocated

To initialise a primitive string, it is how you would expect.
```rust
let hello = "Hello"
```
To initialise a rust-type String:
```rust
let hello = String::from("Hello");
```
#### Get string length
```rust
let hello = String::from("Hello");
println!("{}",hello.len());
Output: 5
```
#### Push **character** onto string
```rust
let hello = String::from("Hello");
hello.push('w'); //single quotes + one char length
println!("{}",hello);
Output: Hellow
```
This will not work if you try to push a string. All of this below will give you an error:
```rust
let hello = String::from("Hello");
hello.push("w"); //double quotes
hello.push("world"); // double quotes + longer than 1 char
hello.push('wo'); // longer than 1 char
```
#### Push onto string
To add an extra string onto another string, we use the `push_str` method.
```rust
let hello = String::from("Hello ");
hello.push_str("world");
println!("{}",hello);
Output: "Hello World"
```

#### Check if empty string
To check if a string is empty, use the `is_empty()` method.
```rust
let hello = String::from("");
println!("{}",hello.is_empty());
Output: true
```

#### String .contains
To check if a string contains a value, use the `contains()` method.
```rust
let hello = String::from("Hello");
println!("Does the string contain 'World': {}", hello.contains("World"));
Output: false
```

#### String .replace 
To replace a string with something else, use the `replace()` method.
```rust
let hello = String::from("Hello World");
println!("Replace: {}", hello.replace("World","There"));
Output: "Hello There"
```

# Tuples


# Loops
#### The `loop` Keyword
The loop keyword will perform an infinite loop in rust.
Usage:
```rust
loop {
    println!("This will be printed indefinitely");
}
```
In order to stop the loop, you must use the `break` keyword, which will *break* out of the loop.
```rust
let mut a = 0;
loop {
    a += 1;
    if a > 9{
        break;
    }

    println!("This will loop until a is 10, then it will break out of the loop");
}
```

#### For Loops
For loops work similarly to any other language.
```rust
// 1..11 - known as an 'iterator'.
for i in 1..11{
    println!("{}",i);
}
```
This will return numbers 1 - 10.
#### Vectors
You can use for loops to loop through vectors.
```rust
let animals = vec!["Rabbit","Dog","Cat"];
for animal in animals.iter(){
    println!("The animal name is {}", animal);
}
```
We call the `.iter()` method on animals to prevents the ownership of the values inside the vector being moved to the for loop. Without the `.iter()` method, you won't be able to access the animals variable after the for loop. So always use `.iter()` with vectors.

#### Indexing
```rust
let animals = vec!["Rabbit","Dog","Cat"];
for (index, animal) in animals.iter().enumerate(){
    println!("The index is {}. The animal name is {}",index, animal);
}
```
The `.enumerate()` method at the end of the expression will allow us to pass a `"tuple"` to have two variables in the for loop `(index, animal)`.
We can now use `index` inside the for loop to find our index.
