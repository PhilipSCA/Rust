# Rust - Learning

# Getting started
1. Download rustup from the [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Run the exe. Follow the simple on-screen instructions for a quick install.
3. Rust is installed! Open a new visual studio code project.
4. Type `cargo new [project name]`, rust will automatically **create** a project folder and the needed files to run a rust project. *(You won't need to create the folder yourself.*
5. It will provide you by default, with a hello world program. cd into the new directory and type cargo run to build and test the new project.
